# PrepStack

> AI-powered mock interview and resume review platform — built entirely in Python.

PrepStack helps job seekers practice interviews with a realistic AI interviewer, get structured feedback on their resume, and walk into real interviews more confident. The project demonstrates end-to-end product engineering: a clean backend API, a lightweight frontend, and practical AI integration — all in a single Python codebase with zero external services required to run locally.

Here is a link of my Medium Article[https://h11laddhad.medium.com/why-i-used-three-different-llms-to-build-one-interview-coach-11131ca489d6] explain the working of real working website in further detail.

## Business context

The job market is competitive. Most candidates are rejected not because they lack the skills, but because they struggle to articulate them under pressure. Traditional preparation tools — static question banks, YouTube videos — offer no feedback loop.

PrepStack closes that gap by simulating the full interview experience: an AI persona asks contextually relevant questions, listens to your answers, pushes back when needed, and then produces a scored debrief with concrete coaching notes. The resume module complements this by reviewing uploaded CVs against role expectations and guiding candidates through targeted improvements — one suggestion at a time.

The core value proposition is **deliberate practice with instant, specific feedback** — the same loop that separates average candidates from strong ones.

## What it does

| Capability | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mock interviews** | Choose an AI persona, interview mode, and duration. The AI conducts a realistic session, asks follow-ups, and scores you at the end. |
| **Resume review** | Upload a PDF. The AI identifies weak points and walks you through a structured improvement wizard. |
| **Voice I/O** | Speak your answers via the browser mic. Hear the AI's questions read aloud — no extra cost, uses the browser's built-in speech engine. |
| **Scorecard** | Post-interview report with per-competency scores, observed strengths, gaps, and a coaching plan. |
| **No login required** | Designed as a demo/portfolio tool — works out of the box without creating an account. |

---

## AI personas

| Persona | Style |
|---|---|
| **Alex** | Professional and neutral — simulates a FAANG-style recruiter screen |
| **Tough Love Terry** | Blunt and demanding — designed to stress-test your answers |
| **Friendly Frankie** | Warm and encouraging — good for first-time practice |
| **The Panel** | Three interviewers rotating across Hiring Manager, Tech Lead, and HR perspectives |

## Interview modes

| Mode | Format |
|---|---|
| **Behavioral** | STAR-method, competency-based questions |
| **Technical** | Problem-solving and role-specific knowledge |
| **Case Study** | Consulting-style structured analysis |
| **Stress Test** | Rapid-fire, intentionally challenging |

## Technical highlights

Built as a portfolio project to demonstrate:

- **FastAPI** — async REST API with streaming responses (Server-Sent Events for live AI output)
- **SQLAlchemy (async)** — ORM with SQLite for zero-setup local storage; swap the connection string for PostgreSQL in production
- **NVIDIA NIM API** — large language model integration via the OpenAI-compatible SDK; different models are selected per interview phase (start, respond, score) to balance cost and quality
- **pypdf** — PDF text extraction for resume parsing
- **Jinja2 + vanilla JS** — lightweight server-rendered frontend; no framework dependencies
- **Browser Speech APIs** — `SpeechRecognition` for voice input, `speechSynthesis` for voice output; free, no third-party key needed
- **Pydantic v2** — request/response validation and internal data modelling throughout

## Quick start

### 1. Clone and create a virtual environment

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd prepstack

python -m venv .venv

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and add your **NVIDIA API key** — that's the only required value:

```
NVIDIA_API_KEY=your-nvidia-api-key
```

Everything else (TTS, email, database path) is optional.

### 3. Run

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). The SQLite database is created automatically on first run — no migration step needed.

### Production

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4
```
